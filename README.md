## Intelligent restaurant review system
Suppose you want to go out and have some Sushi in a restraunt nearby you. Before visiting any such place you want to make sure that they serve best sushi there. So, you check out the reviews given by the customers for the restaurants along with the 5 star ratings. This is a cliche task where you read and analyse all the reviews by yourself. Usually a restaurant is considered to be good on the basis of some set parameters some of which are quality of food, serving speed, hygiene and ambiance of the place, behvaioural conduct of the staff towards customers, etc. We want an intelligent restaurant review system where we got to know about the ratings per quality parameter i.e. according to my requirement(where I want to know about the quality of sushi they serve) system gives me rating for that particular parameter.
To make this type review system we have to first divide all the reviews into simpler sentences and then pass them through a SENTIMENT CLASSIFIER. This sentiment classifier will tell us whether the sentence is a positive or negative one. Based on which it will analyse the rating for the particular quality parameter for that restaurant.
